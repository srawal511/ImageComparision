# ImageComparision

The idea is to compare N pairs of images given in CSV file Using Java as a programming language by resulting another CSV file showing their similarity where 0 means the image are exact same.
It also give informtion on time taken for each comparision.
Code is testes and works perfectly without using any external library and can be run in a simplest way.
Process of using application can be taught to any non technical person by giving small demo and active help in prior stages while using this appliaction.
The maintainer of application (Ferris) has to have detail knowledge about the logic and idea behind this algorithm. 
For simplifying the use for a non technical person and for the maintainer(assuming as non technical person ) most of the components such as images, given csv file(ListCSV.csv) and the main code of an application is kept in same folder.
The Result File is created at the root of the project folder.
